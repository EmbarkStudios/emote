Shoggoth is a flexible framework for reinforcement learning written at Embark.
It is not the final title for the repository but I needed a placeholder.
It is my humble hope that whatever code we produce will be more structured than the
average shoggoth.

## Installation

From [this](https://ealizadeh.com/blog/guide-to-python-env-pkg-dependency-using-conda-poetry) for
information on how to install conda and poetry.

## Installation on Windows

Some of the development dependencies require a working compiler. Install 
[https://www.msys2.org/], then install `mingw-64` and `swig` using `pacman`.
After that you will probably have to invoke `poetry install` from inside the
`MSYS2 MINGW 64` shell.
