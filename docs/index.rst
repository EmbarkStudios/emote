Shoggoth
========

    *It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train â€” a
    shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and
    with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish
    light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the
    frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its
    kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.*

    --- H. P. Lovecraft, *At the Mountains of Madness*

Shoggoth is a flexible framework for reinforcement learning written at Embark.
It is not the final title for the repository but I needed a placeholder.
It is my humble hope that whatever code we produce will be more structured than the
average shoggoth.
